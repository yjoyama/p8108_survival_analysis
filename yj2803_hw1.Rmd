# 1. Exponential Density and Survival-related Functions
(a) Let $\hat{\lambda}$ be the maximum likelihood estimator of the parameter $\lambda$.  
For relapse time:  
$\hat{\lambda}=\frac{6}{5+8+12+24+32+17+16+17+19+30}\approx0.033$  
This indicates that the rate of relapse is about 3.33% per month.  
For relapse time:  
$\hat{\lambda}=\frac{3}{10+12+15+33+45+28+16+17+19+30}\approx0.013$  
This indicates that the rate of death is about 1.33% per month. 

(b)   
i. Mean is $\int_0^\infty t\lambda e^{-\lambda t} dt=\frac{1}{\lambda}$ and I will use $\hat{\lambda}$ to derive the following values.  
Mean time to relapse:  
$\frac{1}{0.033}\approx30.303$ months
Mean survival time:  
$\frac{1}{0.013}\approx76.923$ months  

ii. Median is $0.5=e^{-\lambda \tau} \Rightarrow\tau = \frac{-log(0.5)}{\lambda}$. By $\hat{\lambda}$,  
Median time to relapse:  
$\frac{-log(0.5)}{0.033}\approx21.004$ months
Median survival time:  
$\frac{-log(0.5)}{0.013}\approx53.319$ months
